# ImagineCards

Have you ever played the [Imagine](https://gamewright.com/product/Imagine) board game for 2 hours straight and ran out of enigma cards? When everyone else was tired and mentally exhausted you was like "Boy, we need more cards!"? Really? Then, here you go, you sick board game enthusiast! Endless supply of enigma card:

Just visit <a href="https://zbirizdo.github.io/imagine-cards/" target="_blank">Imagine cards</a>, set up your own cards and the fun never has to stop.

### This app doesn't replaces the board game, only extends it! You still need the physical game to play!      
***

This really simple app uses a Google Drive Sheet as a (readonly) database. Share the sheet with your friends, come up with your own unique enigmas and play them as you would play the regular board game.

*You are out of friends already? Maybe ask an AI to generate enigmas for you!*

### How does it work? How to use this?

When you load the page, the app reads all enigmas, shuffles them and create cards with each 8 chunks
*(there are no cards with enigmas less then 8, so if you have 10 enigmas 2 will be left out and when you reshuffle the "deck", those enigmas will have a chance to come into play).*

On each card you can select one enigma (tap and it will be highlighted).

Play your enigma and give your phone to the next person.

The next person swipe left and he / she will get a new card. (you can't go to the next card without selecting an enigma)

When all cards played you can reshuffle the "deck", and you will get new cards with the enigmas not played / selected yet.

When all enigmas played too, that is when the game is over.

If you refresh the page at any point, the game starts over. (and you lose your progress)

Thats all. Have fun!
